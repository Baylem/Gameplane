# Research: Default telemetry destination, extended telemetry, and telemetry dashboard

**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](plan.md) | **Date**: 2026-10-06

Each entry records a decision, why it was made, and what else was considered. Facts about current code cite `file:line` as of `master` at `d2cc7956`.

## Baseline facts

- **Reporter.** `api/internal/telemetry/telemetry.go` is a ticker loop. Its first report goes out one full interval (24 h) after process start (`Run`, `time.NewTicker(r.interval)`). An API that restarts more often than daily therefore never reports, which violates FR-007. It reads the admin toggle from `config.telemetry.sendMetrics` (`enabled()`), and counts GameServers and GameTemplates on the local cluster only (`count()`).
- **Wiring.** `api/cmd/main.go:392` starts the reporter with a hard-coded `24*time.Hour`. `--telemetry-endpoint`/`GAMEPLANE_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` defaults to `""`, which means off (`api/cmd/main.go:541`).
- **Chart.** `charts/gameplane/templates/api.yaml:323-329` auto-wires `http://gameplane-telemetry-receiver.<ns>.svc:8080/ingest` when `api.telemetry.receiver.enabled` is set and `api.telemetry.endpoint` is empty. The receiver is a `Deployment` with `replicas: {{ $r.replicas }}`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, and no volume. Its NetworkPolicy admits port 8080 only from the API pod, plus an optional Prometheus namespace (`charts/gameplane/templates/telemetry-receiver.yaml`).
- **Receiver.** `telemetry-receiver/main.go` uses only stdlib and `client_golang`. Its strict token-walking decoder (`decodePayload`) rejects any key other than `version`, `servers` and `templates`. Metrics are kept in memory only.
- **API storage.** SQLite is the default and PostgreSQL is optional. New migrations go in `api/internal/db/migrations/common/` as portable SQL; the latest is `014_sessions_digest_reset.sql`. `Store.Migrate` (`api/internal/db/db.go:99`) is called by both `serve` (`api/cmd/main.go:163`) and `bootstrap-admin` (`api/cmd/bootstrap.go:47`).
- **API RBAC.** The API's ClusterRole already grants `get/list/watch` on `nodes`, all Gameplane CRDs including `clusters`, `modulesources` and `backupschedules`, and discovery (`charts/gameplane/templates/api.yaml:15-65`). The handlers already list nodes (`api/internal/handlers/cluster.go:187`) and read `ServerVersion()` (`cluster.go:446`).
- **API replicas.** `charts/gameplane/values.yaml:120` says "Keep at 1", because SQLite is single-writer and some locks are per-process.
- **Admin permissions.** `/admin/config` splits `config:read` (GET) from `config:manage` (`api/internal/rbac/rbac.go:209-210`). Any other `/admin/*` route falls through to the admin wildcard (`rbac.go:217`).
- **Module provenance.** A module-managed GameTemplate carries `gameplane.local/module-name` and `gameplane.local/module-source` labels (`operator/api/v1alpha1/module_types.go:135-139`). The chart's default ModuleSource (`defaultModuleSource.name: default`, OCI `ghcr.io/valgulnecron/gameplane-modules`) lists the official catalog in `defaultModuleSource.oci.modules` (`charts/gameplane/values.yaml:548-584`) and verifies bundles against the chart-shipped cosign key.
- **Web.** There is no i18n framework yet (spec 019 is still Draft), so UI strings are English literals. `AppLayout.tsx:213` already mounts a sticky global banner (`SafeModeBanner`), which is the placement precedent. `AdminSettings.tsx:1545-1576` holds the current single-switch `TelemetrySection`.
- **E2E.** No telemetry E2E exists today. The buckets are `operator api-auth api-roles api-rbac api-agent api-mods ratelimit bot-fast bot-heavy multicluster upgrade` (`test/e2e/buckets.sh:357`). Every bucket shares one Helm install in `deploy/kind/e2e.sh:301`, and `Env.PortForward` exists (`test/e2e/env.go:342`).
- **Egress.** The chart restricts egress only in the games namespace (`networkpolicies.yaml`). The API pod's egress is unrestricted, so the default destination needs no chart egress change.

---

## R1. One source of truth for the report contract

**Decision**: Add a new stdlib-only Go module, `telemetryschema/`. It holds the basic and extended report types, every enumeration and band, the band functions, the strict decoder (moved out of the receiver's `decodePayload` and extended), sanitisation, and the embedded official-module catalog. `api` and `telemetry-receiver` both import it through `replace ../telemetryschema`, following the netguard and gameaction precedent (`api/go.mod:5-16`, `api/Dockerfile:7-9`).

**Rationale**:
- FR-013 requires a *fixed, published* set of categories. Having one package define the categories that the API sends and the receiver accepts means the two sides cannot drift.
- SC-006 requires the preview to match the payload, which is easier when both are built from the same types.
- The receiver stays a single static binary, so it can still be run standalone.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Duplicate the enumerations in both modules and test them against a shared fixture.* This is cheaper up front, but tests that read across modules are brittle and drift is only caught after the fact.
- *Have the API import a sub-package of the receiver module.* This inverts the dependency (client depends on server) and pulls the receiver's `sqlite` and `prometheus` dependencies into the API's module graph.

**Cost**: a 16th Go module must be added to `go.work`, `Makefile` `GO_MODULES`, both module matrices in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` (`:457` and `:549`), the CI path filters, Dependabot, the `CLAUDE.md` repo map and coverage list, and `docs/agent-architecture.md`. It also needs its own `specs.md` (constitution IV). The coverage gate is **90**, matching gameproto (90) and slightly below netguard and gameaction (91), which are the other pure-logic shared libraries. This cost is recorded in plan.md under Complexity Tracking.

## R2. Wire format and backward compatibility

**Decision**: The three basic fields stay at the top level, unchanged. The extended tier is one optional object, `ext`, with its own `schema` integer (starting at `1`). The full shape is in [contracts/report-schema.md](contracts/report-schema.md). The same `POST <endpoint>` URL carries both tiers.

Fallback for older receivers (FR-016, SC-013):
- If a report that carries `ext` gets HTTP **400**, the API immediately re-POSTs the same report without `ext`, once.
- The API then records `ext_unsupported_until = now + 7 days` for that endpoint, so it doesn't send two POSTs every day.
- A receiver that understands `ext` but not a newer `ext.schema` value also answers 400, so the same fallback applies.
- Identity refusals use different codes, so they never trigger this fallback: **403** for a bad signature, stale send time or replay, and **409** for an ID claimed by another key (R20).

**Rationale**:
- Old receivers reject unknown keys (`decodePayload` default branch), so a 400 is a guaranteed and observable signal.
- Keeping one URL means operators who configured a full `/ingest` URL don't have to reconfigure anything.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *A versioned path such as `/v2/ingest`.* Deriving it from an operator-supplied URL is fragile, and the old receiver's 404 would need the same fallback logic anyway.
- *Negotiating through a header.* Old receivers ignore headers, so they would still reject the body.

## R3. Receiver persistence

**Decision**: Store data in SQLite, using `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, and already vetted because the API uses it at `api/go.mod:41`).
- **Location.** The file is `$DATA_DIR/telemetry.db`. When `DATA_DIR` is unset, the receiver uses an in-memory database and logs a warning, so a standalone `docker run` with no volume keeps working, but nothing survives a restart.
- **Chart.** The chart always sets `DATA_DIR=/data` and mounts a PVC by default (`receiver.persistence.enabled: true`, 1 Gi). It uses `strategy: Recreate`, and the template fails if `replicas > 1` while persistence is enabled.
- **Writes.** All writes go through one serialized writer, with WAL mode on.

**Rationale**:
- FR-020 and SC-009 require data to survive restarts.
- 12–24 months of daily aggregates plus about 10k activity records amounts to a few MB.
- SQLite fits a single-replica collector and the distroless image, and needs no new infrastructure (constitution: Kubernetes primitives, meaning a PVC, first).

**Alternatives considered**:
- *PostgreSQL.* This would add an operational dependency for every self-hoster.
- *A JSON file rewritten atomically.* Rewriting it on every ingest doesn't scale to 10k activity records.
- *Prometheus remote storage.* That stores raw-ish time series and cannot do the per-install deduplication from R5.

## R4. Aggregation model (FR-020)

**Decision**: Pre-aggregate per UTC day at ingest time. The tables are listed in [data-model.md](data-model.md) §Receiver.
- **Fleet sizes.** These are stored as an **exact-value histogram** per day and metric, with values capped at 1000 (`1001` means "over 1000"). The FR-024 size bands and the exact median are both derived when the data is read.
- **Extended dimensions.** These go in one generic `daily_dim(day, dim, value, installs)` table, whose `dim` and `value` come only from `telemetryschema` enumerations.
- **Games.** These go in `daily_game(day, module, installs, servers)`.
- **Cumulative total.** A running total of reports is kept in `meta`, so the public summary's "total since collection began" (FR-029) is unaffected by retention sweeps.

**Rationale**:
- Every dashboard view becomes a scan of at most 365 rows per dimension, which keeps SC-010 (under 3 s) comfortable.
- Bounded enumerations bound the row count, so hostile input can't grow tables without limit (Edge Cases: malicious values).
- An exact histogram gives the real median that US4 scenario 3 asks for; band-only storage would only give a median band.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Storing reports and aggregating at read time.* FR-014 forbids storing raw reports.
- *Storing bands only.* This loses the exact median.

**Range semantics**:
- **Basic "per day" views** chart daily values over the range.
- **Extended install-share views** (environment, games, features) show the sum of daily install counts divided by the sum of daily extended reports over the range, which is a share weighted by install-days. Each view is labelled "share of reporting installs, averaged over the range".
- **By-install version adoption** (US5 scenario 6) uses activity records, so it covers at most the activity-expiry window (OD-4). The dashboard states that window.

## R5. Unique installs without linking attributes (FR-014, FR-015)

**Decision**:
- **Install ID.** The API generates a UUIDv4 from `crypto/rand`.
- **Transformed ID.** The receiver stores only `HMAC-SHA256(pepper, installID)`, hex-encoded. The pepper comes from `ID_PEPPER`, a Secret. If that is unset, the receiver generates 32 random bytes on first start and keeps them in `meta`.
- **Activity record.** Each record holds the transformed ID, `key_fp` (the claim, R20), `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `last_sent_at` (replay guard, R20) and `last_version`. Nothing else.
- **Per-day deduplication.** For an extended report that has passed the R20 signature and claim checks:
  - If no record exists, the receiver inserts one, which also claims the ID, and counts the report as `new_installs++` and `active_installs++`.
  - If `last_seen < today`, it updates the record and counts `active_installs++`.
  - If `last_seen == today`, the report is a **duplicate**. It is answered with 204 but changes no aggregate, basic or extended; only `daily_basic.duplicates` is incremented.
- **Lapsed installs.** An hourly rollover finalizes each completed day D. It sets `lapsed_installs[D] = count(activity where last_seen = D − 30)` and then deletes records whose `last_seen` is older than the expiry (OD-4, ruled: 90 days; the enforced minimum is 31).

**Rationale**:
- An HMAC with a secret pepper means the stored value can't be matched against an ID taken from an install without that pepper.
- No extended attribute is ever written next to the ID, as FR-014 requires.
- Per-day deduplication stops restarts, retries and replays from inflating counts (Edge Cases: frequent restarts, spoofing).
- SC-008 (within 1 %) holds because uniques are exact distinct counts, not estimates.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *HyperLogLog sketches.* These are approximate (around 1–2 % error) and can't give exact new and lapsed counts.
- *Plain SHA-256 of the ID.* An attacker who knows the ID can link it. That is low risk, but the pepper costs nothing.

## R6. Per-source limits and source addresses (FR-014, FR-021, FR-032)

**Decision**: All limits are in memory only and keyed by source, which is never written to disk. A source is the IPv4 address (IPv4-mapped IPv6 included) or the IPv6 /64, so one host can't rotate through its prefix.
- **Ingest.** At most `INGEST_SOURCE_DAILY_LIMIT` *accepted* reports per source per UTC day, default **20**. Over the limit the receiver returns `429`.
- **Public summary.** A token bucket of 60 requests per minute per source, burst 10.
- **Dashboard login.** 5 attempts per minute per source.
- **Source IP.** This is the TCP peer address. `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted only when the peer falls inside `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (default empty).
- **Cleanup.** Daily counters reset at UTC midnight. Token buckets are purged after 10 idle minutes (daily counters are not, or an idle source would regain its budget).
- **Capacity.** Each limiter tracks at most 100,000 sources and evicts the least-recently-used one to admit a new source. Two other designs were rejected:
  - Letting sources past the cap through untracked was a bypass (security review of 4c742e7d).
  - Pooling them into one overflow budget let an attacker who filled the table deny every new legitimate source (security review of de5d0974).

  With eviction, a source's budget can only be reset by an attacker who controls more distinct IPv4 addresses or IPv6 /64s than the cap. At that scale per-source limiting no longer applies, and the dashboard token is high-entropy anyway.

**Rationale**:
- A default of 20 tolerates CGNAT and shared egress (several homelabs behind one address) while capping how much one source can distort a day.
- Trusting proxy headers only from configured networks stops clients from spoofing their source by setting `X-Forwarded-For` themselves.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *A limit of 1 per source per day.* This breaks every install behind a shared NAT.
- *Proof-of-work or registration.* This can't be done without per-install secrets (spec Assumptions).

## R7. Private dashboard delivery (FR-022–FR-028)

**Decision**:
- **Rendering.** The receiver renders the dashboard itself with `html/template`. CSS and templates are embedded with `go:embed`, and charts are **inline SVG** generated server-side. There is **no JavaScript**.
- **Range selection.** The range is chosen with plain links (`?range=7|30|90|365`, default 30).
- **Listener.** The dashboard has its own listener, `DASHBOARD_LISTEN_ADDR` (default `:8081`), separate from the public listener (`:8080`: ingest, healthz, public summary). Templates use no inline `style` attributes or `<style>` blocks, because the CSP sets `style-src 'self'`; SVG presentation attributes are fine. Prometheus `/metrics` also moves to the dashboard listener, behind the token (spec Q8), so no aggregate other than the public summary is readable from the public port.
- **CSP.** `default-src 'none'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'`.
- **Chart design.** Designs come from frames in `telemetry-receiver/telemetry-dashboard.pen` (spec Q10), a separate Pencil file seeded with a copy of the HeroUI design, exported to `telemetry-receiver/design-export/`. The rendered HTML recreates the HeroUI look in plain CSS, because there is no React (constitution II, by analogy). The `dataviz` skill is applied when the frames are designed and again when the SVG is implemented.

**Rationale**:
- Rendering in-process keeps the receiver one static binary with no build toolchain, as required for self-hosting (FR-033).
- Without JavaScript, the CSP can be very strict.
- A separate port lets the project's provider expose only `:8080` publicly while the dashboard stays private at the network level as well.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Reusing the `web/` React app.* This would couple the receiver's release to the dashboard build, and the dashboard isn't deployed next to a public provider.
- *A Grafana dashboard.* This needs Grafana and Prometheus history, can't express the dedupe-aware install views, and would expose the provider's metrics endpoint.

## R8. Dashboard access credential (FR-022, FR-023, FR-028)

**Decision**: There is one operator credential, `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, which comes from a Secret.
- **No token.** If `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` is unset, the dashboard listener **is not started** at all, so the dashboard is unavailable rather than open.
- **Browser login.** `POST /login` compares the token in constant time. On success it sets a cookie containing `expiry || HMAC-SHA256(K, expiry)`, where `K = HMAC-SHA256(DASHBOARD_TOKEN, "gameplane-telemetry-session")`. The cookie is `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/` with a 12 h lifetime. Because `K` is derived from the token, replacing the token invalidates every session, and the stored data is untouched.
- **CSRF.** `POST /login` and `POST /logout` require a same-origin `Origin` (or `Referer`) header in addition to SameSite.
- **Scripts.** The JSON views endpoint also accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Refusals.** Any unauthenticated HTML request is redirected to `/login`. Any unauthenticated JSON request gets `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}`. A wrong token re-renders the login page with "Invalid credentials". No response varies with whether any data exists.

**Rationale**:
- Single-credential access is a spec Assumption.
- A stateless signed cookie needs no session table, and it rotates naturally with the token.
- The generic responses follow the same privacy posture as Gameplane's own login (CLAUDE.md core rule 3).

**Alternatives considered**:
- *HTTP Basic auth.* Browsers cache it, and it can't be logged out of.
- *OIDC.* This is out of scope, since there are no multi-user accounts on the provider.

## R9. Public summary (FR-029–FR-032)

**Decision**: `GET /v1/summary` on the public listener, returning only the five values in [contracts/receiver-http.md](contracts/receiver-http.md).
- **When disabled.** If `PUBLIC_SUMMARY` is not `true` (the default), the route returns 404.
- **Caching.** The response is computed from a snapshot cached for 5 minutes, sent with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600` and an `ETag`.
- **CORS.** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, because the response is read-only and carries no credentials.
- **Rate limit.** As in R6.

**Rationale**:
- Badge and website use cases need cross-origin reads that can be cached.
- The snapshot cache keeps public polling off the database (FR-032, US6 scenario 4).

**Alternatives considered**:
- *A shields.io badge format.* It's a different representation of the same data, and can be added later without changing the data contract.

## R10. Telling a new install from an existing one

**Decision**:
- **Fresh check.** `Store.Migrate` checks whether `schema_migrations` held **zero rows** when it started; if so, the database is fresh.
- **Seeding.** After applying migrations, `Migrate` runs a one-time seeding step in the same process. If no `telemetry_state` row exists, it inserts one:
  - **fresh:** `consent_source='default'`, and `config.telemetry = {"sendMetrics":true,"extended":true}`.
  - **existing:** `consent_source='legacy'`. Any saved `config.telemetry` is kept, with `extended:false` added; with nothing saved, the config row stays absent, which means off.

**Rationale**:
- The check runs inside `Migrate`, which both entrypoints call, so it's correct whichever runs first. That includes `bootstrap-admin` running before the first `serve`, which would otherwise make a fresh install look existing.
- Reinstalling over an existing PVC, or reusing a populated PostgreSQL database, counts as existing, as the spec's Edge Cases require.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Counting users.* Wrong after `bootstrap-admin`.
- *A Helm hook that marks fresh installs.* Breaks for `--reuse-values` and non-Helm installs.
- *A pure-SQL migration.* Portable SQL can't read the existing JSON config value.

## R11. Consent, notice and state storage (FR-003–FR-005, FR-012, FR-017–FR-019)

**Decision**: Three stores, split by who may write them.
- **`config.telemetry`** (existing key → JSON) holds the admin's choice, `{sendMetrics, extended}`. It is still edited via `PUT /admin/config/telemetry` (`api/internal/handlers/config.go:56`). Saving `sendMetrics: false` also saves `extended: false` (FR-003, spec Q7), and the UI disables the extended switch and shows it off while basic is off. A post-save hook for the `telemetry` section (following the `auth` hook at `api/internal/handlers/config.go:131`) does three things in the same transaction:
  - sets `consent_source='admin'`
  - deletes the install ID when extended goes off
  - creates one when extended goes on

  When the operator has disabled telemetry, the handler returns `409`.
- **`telemetry_state`** (new singleton table) holds machine state: consent source, install ID, notice-shown time, schedule, delivery status, and the extended-fallback marker. No admin config endpoint can write it.
- **`telemetry_notice_acks`** (new table, keyed by `user_id`) records each admin's notice dismissal.
- **Notice condition.** The notice is pending for a user who holds `config:manage` when all of these hold:
  - a destination is in effect, meaning the kind isn't `none` or `disabled`
  - `consent_source = 'default'`
  - the user has no ack row
- **Report gate.** Reports are allowed only when `sendMetrics` is true, the destination kind is not `disabled` or `none`, and either `consent_source` isn't `'default'` or `notice_shown_at` is set.

**Rationale**:
- The install ID can't be written through the generic config endpoint, so no config write can set or spoof it.
- The Admin Settings section keeps its existing save flow.
- "Shown" is recorded when the dashboard actually renders the notice (`POST .../notice {"action":"seen"}`), which matches the spec's "shown" wording more closely than recording when the API serves it.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Everything in `config.telemetry`.* An admin `PUT /admin/config/telemetry` could then set the ID, and the delivery state would show up in GET `/admin/config`.
- *Gating reports on dismissal instead of display.* Stricter than the spec ("within 1 hour of the notice being *shown*"), and it would leave telemetry stuck if an admin never clicks.

## R12. Scheduling (FR-007, SC-005)

**Decision**: The schedule is persisted, and replicas claim each slot.
- **Polling.** The reporter checks every `min(5m, interval/4)`.
- **Gate open.** When the gate first opens (notice seen, or admin consent), it sets `next_due_at = now + U(0, min(15m, interval/4))`.
- **Claiming a slot.** A process claims a due slot with:
  ```sql
  UPDATE telemetry_state
  SET next_due_at = ?, last_attempt_at = ?
  WHERE id = 'singleton' AND next_due_at = ?
  ```
  It proceeds only if exactly one row changed.
- **After success.** `next_due_at = now + interval + U(0, interval/48)`.
- **After failure.** Back off 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and so on, capped at `interval`, tracked in `consecutive_failures`. Reports are never queued or replayed.
- **Interval setting.** `--telemetry-interval` / `GAMEPLANE_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL` (default `24h`, minimum `1m`; chart value documented as testing-only).

**Rationale**:
- Persisting the schedule survives restarts.
- The conditional UPDATE is portable to SQLite and Postgres and stays safe even if someone ignores "Keep at 1" for API replicas.
- A spacing of at least `interval` after every *accepted* report gives the "at most one per 24 h" guarantee.
- Jitter spreads load on the default provider.

**Alternatives considered**:
- *Keeping the ticker.* Defeated by restarts.
- *Leader election.* Too heavy for a once-a-day POST.

## R13. Resolving the destination (FR-001, FR-002, FR-005, FR-006, FR-009, FR-017)

**Decision**: The API resolves exactly one destination kind, in this order:

| Condition (first match wins) | Kind | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `--telemetry-disabled` / `GAMEPLANE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true` | `disabled` | none |
| endpoint flag set and `GAMEPLANE_TELEMETRY_BUNDLED=true` (set only by the chart's auto-wiring) | `bundled` | the flag value |
| endpoint flag set | `custom` | the flag value |
| `telemetry.DefaultEndpoint != ""` | `default` | the constant |
| otherwise | `none` | none |

- `telemetry.DefaultEndpoint` is a Go constant in `api/internal/telemetry`, and is **`""` until OD-1 is ruled**. The feature PR can't merge while it is empty (plan.md, Merge gate). That makes it the single authoritative place FR-002 asks for. The chart never repeats the URL.
- The `default` kind requires an `https` scheme; a non-https default is a startup error. TLS uses the system roots with full verification, as FR-009 requires.
- `custom` and `bundled` keep today's behaviour: any scheme, because the bundled receiver is plain in-cluster HTTP.
- The chart's new value `api.telemetry.enabled` (default `true`) renders `--telemetry-disabled` when false. The template uses `hasKey`, because `--reuse-values` from beta.8 lacks the key (F-214 precedent at `api.yaml:394-399`).

**Rationale**: SC-004 requires a single setting for either action: `api.telemetry.enabled=false` disables telemetry, and `api.telemetry.endpoint=…` redirects it. The `none` kind keeps today's behaviour exactly until a domain exists.

## R14. Where each extended field comes from (FR-011)

No new RBAC is needed; every source is already readable (see the baseline facts).

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `env.k8s` | `Discovery().ServerVersion()` Major/Minor | Digits are kept. Values not matching `^1\.[0-9]{1,3}$` are sent as `other`. |
| `env.distro` | R16 heuristics | |
| `env.arch` | `node.Status.NodeInfo.Architecture` across local nodes | Sorted and unique; any non-enumerated value is sent as `other`. |
| `env.nodes` | local node count | Bands: `1`, `2-3`, `4-10`, `11-50`, `51+`. The spec's "50+" means more than 50. |
| `games` | local GameServers → `spec.templateRef` → GameTemplate labels | See R15. |
| `features.wakeOnConnect` | any local GameServer with `spec.idle.wakeOnConnect` | `operator/api/v1alpha1/gameserver_types.go:152`, `:218` |
| `features.tunnels` | set of `spec.tunnel.provider` where `tunnel.enabled` | Enumeration: `frp`, `tailscale`, `playit`. |
| `features.capture` | API `cfg.captureFeatureEnabled` | |
| `features.backups` | at least one BackupSchedule in the cluster | |
| `features.sso` | Helm OIDC configured (`cfg.oidcIssuer != ""`), or a DB `auth` provider of kind `oidc`, `google` or `github` that is enabled | |
| `features.auditForwarding` | `cfg.auditWebhookURL != ""`, or the S3 sink is configured (`cfg.auditS3Endpoint != "" && cfg.auditS3Bucket != ""`, `api/cmd/main.go:234`) | stdout logging doesn't count |
| `features.clusters` | 1 (local) plus the number of `Cluster` CRs | Bands: `1`, `2-3`, `4-10`, `11+` |
| `features.db` | `cfg.dbDriver` | `sqlite` or `postgres` |
| `features.language` | `"en"` until spec 019 ships a language setting | Spec 019 owns adding real values to the enumeration. |

**Counting scope**: servers, templates and games are counted on the **local cluster only**, the same as today's basic `servers` and `templates`. FR-010 keeps the basic semantics unchanged, and remote reads can fail. Multi-cluster use shows up through `features.clusters`.

## R15. Official modules and look-alikes (FR-011, FR-034)

**Decision**:
- **On the install.**
  - The chart passes `--official-module-source=<defaultModuleSource.name>` (`GAMEPLANE_OFFICIAL_MODULE_SOURCE`), and only when `defaultModuleSource.enabled`.
  - A GameServer counts as running official module `m` only if its template has all three of:
    - `managed-by=Module`
    - `module-source` equal to that source's name
    - `module-name = m`, where `m` appears in the source's `spec.oci.modules[].name` (or the git index)
  - Everything else is summed under `custom`: manual templates, uploads, other sources, and look-alike names. No other name ever leaves the cluster.
- **On the receiver.** `telemetryschema` embeds `catalog.txt`, which is generated from `charts/gameplane/values.yaml` `defaultModuleSource.oci.modules`. The receiver folds any key not in that list into `custom`, which bounds cardinality and blocks spoofed names.
- **Drift check.** A new script, `hack/check-telemetry-catalog.sh`, fails `make lint` and CI when the list and the chart differ. It runs alongside `hack/check-specs.sh`.

**Known limitation**: a module added to the catalog after a receiver was built counts as `custom` on that receiver until the receiver is updated. This is documented.

## R16. Kubernetes distribution detection

**Decision**: The first match wins, using signals the API can already read:

| Distribution | Signal |
|---|---|
| `k3s` | `gitVersion` contains `+k3s` |
| `rke2` | `gitVersion` contains `+rke2` |
| `k0s` | `gitVersion` contains `+k0s` |
| `eks` | `gitVersion` contains `-eks-` |
| `gke` | `gitVersion` contains `-gke.` |
| `aks` | node label `kubernetes.azure.com/cluster` |
| `openshift` | node label `node.openshift.io/os_id` |
| `microk8s` | node label `microk8s.io/cluster` |
| `minikube` | node label `minikube.k8s.io/name` |
| `kind` | node `spec.providerID` starts with `kind://` |
| `doks` | `providerID` starts with `digitalocean://` |
| `talos` | `nodeInfo.osImage` starts with `Talos` |
| `other` | anything else, including plain kubeadm |

**Rationale**: no new RBAC and no kube-system reads are needed, and the list is fixed and published (FR-013). Plain kubeadm can't be told apart cheaply, so it falls into `other`, which is accepted.

## R17. E2E strategy (constitution I)

**Decision**:
- **New `telemetry` bucket.** It contains one top-level test, `TestTelemetryLifecycle`, which calls `t.Parallel()` and runs ordered subtests. It is the bucket's only test, because later steps run `helm upgrade` on that bucket's own cluster. The receiver's ingest limit is raised for this cluster (`INGEST_SOURCE_DAILY_LIMIT=0`, meaning unlimited) and `api.telemetry.interval=1m`. The subtests, in order:
  - The fresh install's notice is pending.
  - Recording it as seen makes the first report arrive at the bundled receiver.
  - Duplicate reports on the same day are deduplicated.
  - Turning extended off makes the next report basic-only.
  - Resetting the ID shows up as a new install.
  - An API pod restart causes no extra report.
  - Pointing at a custom destination running the pinned `v0.2.0-beta.8` receiver image gets basic reports accepted, via the extended fallback.
  - The public summary returns exactly five keys.
  - A report reusing the install's ID but signed with another key gets 409. An unsigned report, a tampered body and a replayed body each get 403. None of them change any figure (SC-014).
  - A second test-only client claims a freshly reset ID before the install's first report. The install's next attempt then returns 409, it rotates its ID, and its report is accepted (SC-015).
  - An unauthenticated dashboard request reveals nothing.
  - `api.telemetry.enabled=false` leads to zero further reports over 3 intervals, and the settings show "disabled by operator".
- **Upgrade bucket.** Add an assertion that a beta.8 install with no saved choice upgrades to `sendMetrics=false`, `extended=false`, and no pending notice.
- **No test or dev install may ever reach the project provider.** `deploy/kind/e2e.sh` and `deploy/kind/up.sh` set `api.telemetry.receiver.enabled=true` explicitly, and the CI `helm template` jobs assert this. Without it, every CI and dev install would report to the project provider once OD-1 sets the default.

**Rationale**:
- The lifecycle steps depend on each other's state, so one sequential test is the honest shape.
- An isolated bucket keeps the cluster-wide `helm upgrade` away from other buckets and the login budget (CLAUDE.md: about 7 admin logins per bucket) untouched.
- Test-only configuration lives in chart values, not in production code paths.

## R18. Admin UI surface (US1, US3; constitution II)

**Decision**:
- **Notice.** A new `TelemetryNotice` banner, mounted in `AppLayout` next to `SafeModeBanner` and shown only to holders of `config:manage`. It records "seen" when it mounts and offers three actions: "Keep sharing", "Turn off extended", and "Turn off all". Each action records an acknowledgement, and the banner also links to Admin Settings.
- **Settings.** `AdminSettings` `TelemetrySection` is rewritten to show:
  - the destination line (kind and host, with a link to the data-handling statement on the project website, per the OD-2 ruling)
  - two switches; the extended switch is disabled while basic is off
  - the install ID with a "Reset ID" action, confirmed in a dialog
  - the live preview, as read-only formatted JSON
  - the delivery status line
  - when the operator has disabled telemetry, both switches are disabled and an explanatory message is shown
- **Copy.** The subtitle "No server names, player counts, or identifying data" changes to say that the extended tier includes a random install ID (FR-019).
- **Design.** The notice and settings frames are designed first in `design.pen` and exported to `design-export/` (core rule 1). The receiver's pages are designed in `telemetry-receiver/telemetry-dashboard.pen` and exported to `telemetry-receiver/design-export/`. The frames are:
  - the notice banner
  - the Telemetry settings section in its default, custom, bundled, disabled and none states
  - the receiver's dashboard login, overview (basic plus extended), empty-state and refusal pages

## R19. The language field before spec 019

**Decision**: `features.language` is always sent as `"en"`, and the enumeration is `["en"]`. When spec 019 lands, it adds its packs to the `telemetryschema` enumeration and wires the configured default. This cross-spec dependency is recorded in plan.md.

**Rationale**: FR-011 lists the field and FR-013 requires a fixed set. Sending a constant is honest about the current product state, and 019 extends it without a schema bump, because new enumeration values on an older receiver fold into `other`.

## R20. Signed reports and install-ID claims (FR-035–FR-038, US7)

**Decision**:
- **Algorithm.** Ed25519 (`crypto/ed25519`) with HKDF-SHA256 (`crypto/hkdf`). Both are stdlib (Go 1.24+), so `telemetryschema` stays stdlib-only and owns signing and verification for both sides.
- **Stable local value (Q5).**
  - `telemetry_state.signing_secret` holds 32 bytes from `crypto/rand`, base64-encoded. It is created the first time an install ID is created and kept for the install's lifetime, including across ID resets and extended off/on.
  - No endpoint, log, audit event or report ever exposes it.
  - It is never derived from the cluster's identity (kube-system UID, node names and so on), which keeps FR-012 intact.
- **Key derivation.** The key is:

  ```text
  seed = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = signing_secret, salt = installId, info = "gameplane-telemetry-signing-v1", L = 32)
  priv = ed25519.NewKeyFromSeed(seed)
  ```

  It is recomputed on every send and never stored. Because `installId` is part of the derivation, a reset (or an automatic rotation) yields a key that can't be linked to the previous one (US7 scenario 5).
- **What's on the wire.**
  - `ext.key` holds the base64url (unpadded) 32-byte public key.
  - `ext.sentAt` holds the RFC 3339 UTC send time.
  - The header `Gameplane-Telemetry-Signature: ed25519=<base64url signature>` signs the exact request body bytes. Signing raw bytes avoids JSON canonicalisation pitfalls, and because the key and send time are inside the body, both are covered.
  - Basic-only reports carry neither the fields nor the header (FR-038).
- **Receiver checks.** These run in order for reports that carry `ext`. They happen before the limiter counts the report as accepted and before any write. Every refusal has a fixed body and changes nothing:
  1. If the header is missing or malformed, or the signature doesn't verify against `ext.key` over the body: **403** `{"error":"bad_signature"}`.
  2. If `sentAt` is outside `[now − 36h, now + 1h]`: **403** `{"error":"stale"}`.
  3. The receiver looks up `activity[HMAC(pepper, installId)]`.
     - **Absent**: it claims the ID by inserting a record with `key_fp = SHA-256(ext.key)` and `last_sent_at = sentAt`.
     - **Present**: if `key_fp` differs, **409** `{"error":"id_claimed"}`. If `sentAt ≤ last_sent_at`, **403** `{"error":"replay"}`. Otherwise it updates the record.
  4. Aggregation and per-day deduplication then follow R5.
- **API behaviour (Q6).**
  - **409**: generate a new install ID (keep `signing_secret`), set `last_id_rotation_at`, rebuild and re-sign the report, and re-POST once in the same attempt. A second 409 in a row is recorded as `failed` with normal backoff, and the ID isn't rotated again until the next attempt.
  - **403**: recorded as `failed` with normal backoff. The ID is never rotated (Edge Cases: install clock wrong).
- **Claim lifetime.** The claim is the activity record. It expires when the record does (90 days, OD-4) and is re-established by the next valid report (FR-038).

**Rationale**:
- A claim on first use needs no project-issued secret and no registration step, which suits anonymous installs.
- Per-ID derived keys make "claim" and "reset unlinkability" the same mechanism.
- Signing the raw body covers every field, including the tier contents.
- Strictly increasing `sentAt` per ID, combined with the 36 h window, blocks replays of captured reports. Per-day deduplication alone would still let a capture be replayed on the next day.
- Storing the key's fingerprint rather than the key itself avoids keeping a second linkable identifier; the full key arrives with every report anyway.

**What signing does not solve**: anyone can invent fresh IDs and keys and claim them, so fabricated installs are still possible. Per-source limits (R6) and the "approximate, self-reported" labelling remain the defence. Real attestation would need a secret issued by the project to each install, which the anonymous model rules out (spec Assumptions).

**Alternatives considered**:
- *A secret stored in a Kubernetes Secret.* It survives a database wipe, but the ID doesn't, so there's no gain, and anyone who can read Secrets in the namespace could forge reports (Q5).
- *The kube-system namespace UID.* It isn't secret, needs new `namespaces` RBAC, and conflicts with FR-012 (Q5).
- *HMAC with a key shared with the provider.* The provider would then hold the secret and could forge reports itself, and the secret would have to be distributed.
- *Counting only the basic part on a mismatch.* An impersonator would still inflate basic counts (Q6).
- *Mutual TLS client certificates.* This needs a CA and per-install issuance, and breaks for plain-HTTP bundled receivers.
