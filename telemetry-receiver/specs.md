# telemetry-receiver — Specification

**Status:** pre-v1 (v0.3.0)  
**Module / package:** github.com/ValgulNecron/gameplane/telemetry-receiver  
**Go version:** 1.26

## Purpose

Optional collector for the usage telemetry that Gameplane installs report daily. It runs as the chart's bundled in-cluster receiver, as a self-hosted provider for other installs, or as the project's default receiver. It accepts small JSON reports (a basic tier and a signed extended tier), validates them strictly, folds them into daily aggregates and expiring activity records, and shows the result on a private dashboard.

## Responsibilities

- **Two HTTP listeners**:
  - public (`LISTEN_ADDR`, default `:8080`): `/ingest` (POST), `/v1/summary` (GET), `/v1/challenge` (GET), `/healthz` (GET)
  - dashboard (`DASHBOARD_LISTEN_ADDR`, default `:8081`): started only when `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` is set; serves `/login`, `/logout`, `/`, `/api/v1/views`, `/metrics` and `/static/*`
- **Payload validation**: delegated to `telemetryschema.Decode`: exactly one JSON object, exact case-sensitive keys, duplicates and nulls rejected, trailing non-whitespace rejected, unknown fields rejected, negative counts rejected, oversized bodies (>16 KiB) rejected. A report is a basic report (`version`, `servers`, `templates`) or a basic report with an `ext` part; both are strictly validated
- **Extended identity checks**: an extended report must carry a valid `Gameplane-Telemetry-Signature` (Ed25519 over the exact body bytes, under the key in `ext.key`). The receiver also refuses a send time outside `[now - 36h, now + 1h]` (`stale`), a key that differs from the one that first claimed the install ID (`id_claimed`) and a send time not later than the last accepted one (`replay`)
- **Proof-of-work (optional)**: with `INGEST_POW=true`, `/ingest` requires a solved challenge from `/v1/challenge` before the body is read; difficulty adapts to the challenge rate
- **Aggregation and storage**: daily aggregates and expiring per-install activity records in SQLite (`$DATA_DIR/telemetry.db`); an install ID is stored only as `HMAC-SHA256(pepper, installID)`
- **Per-source limits**: accepted reports per source per UTC day (`INGEST_SOURCE_DAILY_LIMIT`), login attempts, summary reads and challenge requests, all held in memory; source addresses come from the TCP peer, or from `X-Forwarded-For` only when the peer is inside `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`
- **Dashboard**: server-rendered HTML with inline SVG charts and no JavaScript, behind one operator token; the same view model is served as JSON at `/api/v1/views`
- **Public summary (optional)**: `GET /v1/summary` returns five counts when `PUBLIC_SUMMARY=true`
- **Version sanitization**: invalid syntax is bucketed as `"invalid"`. Retain at most 128 distinct strings matching `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._+-]{0,31}$` per process for the Prometheus label; additional versions share `"other"`. The two bucket names are reserved, for at most 130 series. Retained labels are never evicted; restart resets the budget with the counters.
- **Metrics**: Prometheus series on the dashboard listener only, behind the token
- **Lifecycle**: an hourly job finalizes completed UTC days, expires activity records and deletes daily aggregates older than `RETENTION_DAYS`
- **Structured logging**: logs each accepted report via `log/slog` with version/servers/templates fields (and `extended`); source addresses are never logged
- **Request timeouts**: whole request read is time-bounded (15 s read timeout, 10 s header timeout)

## Non-goals / boundaries

The receiver trusts nothing it is sent: reports are self-reported and unauthenticated by design on a public provider, so figures are approximate and the dashboard labels them that way. It does not issue credentials to installs, does not run alongside a second writer on the same database (single replica), and has no multi-user accounts: one dashboard token is the only credential. The API's consent switches (`Admin Settings → Telemetry`) decide whether an install sends anything; the receiver cannot see or enforce them. Refer to `telemetry-receiver/README.md` for configuration and run instructions and to `docs/telemetry-provider.md` for the provider runbook.

## External interface / contracts

The full contract is `specs/022-default-telemetry-dashboard/contracts/receiver-http.md`; the report format is `contracts/report-schema.md`.

### Public listener (`LISTEN_ADDR`)

| Route | Method | Success response | Failures |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|
| `/ingest` | POST | `204 No Content` (also for a same-day duplicate extended report, which only counts in `duplicates`) | `400` structural error; `401` missing/wrong Authorization (when `AUTH_TOKEN` set); `403` `bad_signature`, `stale` or `replay`; `409` `id_claimed`; `413` body >16 KiB; `428` `pow_required` or `pow_invalid`; `429` per-source daily limit; `503` `pow_busy` with `Retry-After: 60` |
| `/v1/summary` | GET | `200` JSON with exactly `asOf`, `reportsLatestDay`, `reports30d`, `reportsTotal`, `activeInstalls30d` | `404` unless `PUBLIC_SUMMARY=true`; `429` per-source rate limit |
| `/v1/challenge` | GET | `200` JSON `{challenge, bits, expiresAt}`, `Cache-Control: no-store` | `404` unless `INGEST_POW=true`; `429` (10 per minute, burst 5 per source) |
| `/healthz` | GET | `200 OK`, body `"ok"` | Never errors |

`/ingest` runs its checks in this order: `AUTH_TOKEN`, proof-of-work, body read, decode, extended identity checks, per-source daily limit, store. A refused report changes no stored data. Every other path, including `/metrics`, answers `404`.

### Dashboard listener (`DASHBOARD_LISTEN_ADDR`)

| Route | Method | Auth | Result |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| `/login` | GET, POST | none; POST takes form field `token`, same-origin `Origin` required | form; on success `303` to `/` and a session cookie; "Invalid credentials" otherwise; `429` after 5 attempts per minute per source |
| `/logout` | POST | session, same-origin | `303` to `/login`, clears the cookie |
| `/` | GET | session | overview for `?range=7\|30\|90\|365` (default 30); unauthenticated gets `303` to `/login` |
| `/api/v1/views` | GET | session cookie or `Authorization: Bearer <DASHBOARD_TOKEN>` | `200` JSON view model; otherwise `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` |
| `/metrics` | GET | Bearer token only | Prometheus text; otherwise `401 {"error":"unauthorized"}` |
| `/static/*` | GET | none | embedded CSS and icon only |

The session cookie is `gp_telemetry_session` (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`, 12 hours); its key derives from `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, so replacing the token invalidates every session. Every dashboard response carries a strict `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.

### Configuration (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Public listener |
| `DASHBOARD_LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8081` | Dashboard listener |
| `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Dashboard credential. Empty means no dashboard listener. When set it must be at least 32 characters or the receiver exits at startup |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | When set, `/ingest` requires an exactly-matching `Authorization` header (constant-time compare) |
| `DATA_DIR` | *(empty)* | SQLite directory. Empty means in-memory (a warning is logged and everything is lost on restart) |
| `PUBLIC_SUMMARY` | `false` | `true` enables `/v1/summary` |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated CIDRs whose `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted; a malformed entry stops startup |
| `INGEST_SOURCE_DAILY_LIMIT` | `20` | Accepted reports per source per UTC day; `0` means unlimited; negative is refused |
| `RETENTION_DAYS` | `730` | Daily aggregate retention; minimum `365` |
| `ACTIVITY_EXPIRY_DAYS` | `90` | Activity record expiry; minimum `31` |
| `ID_PEPPER` | *(empty)* | HMAC pepper for install IDs. Empty means one is generated and kept in the database |
| `INGEST_POW` | `false` | `true` requires proof-of-work on `/ingest` and serves `/v1/challenge` |
| `INGEST_POW_TARGET_PER_MIN` | `60` | Normal challenge rate: at or below it no work is required. Must be at least 1 |
| `INGEST_POW_MIN_BITS` | `0` | Lowest difficulty issued. Must not be negative |
| `INGEST_POW_MAX_BITS` | `22` | Highest difficulty issued. At least `INGEST_POW_MIN_BITS` and at most 26 (the hardest challenge an install solves) |

An unparsable or out-of-range value stops the receiver at start with an `invalid configuration` error.

### Proof-of-work

Challenges are stateless: `base64url(payload) "." base64url(mac)`, where the payload holds a version byte, the issue time, the difficulty in bits and 16 random bytes, and the MAC is the first 16 bytes of HMAC-SHA256 under a 32-byte key generated at process start and kept in memory. A challenge expires after 15 minutes. The sender finds a decimal nonce so that `SHA-256(challenge ":" nonce)` starts with at least `bits` zero bits and sends `Gameplane-Telemetry-PoW: <challenge>:<nonce>`.

Difficulty: with `r` challenges issued in the trailing 60 seconds (counting the new one) and `T = INGEST_POW_TARGET_PER_MIN`, the target is `0` when `r <= T`, otherwise `min(MAX, ceil(2*log2(r/T)))`. The issued difficulty is `max(MIN, target, peak - floor((now - peakAt) / 5 min))`, so it rises on the next challenge and falls one bit per five minutes.

Verification (before the body is read): header present and well formed, MAC valid, not expired, enough leading zero bits as stated in the token, not already used. A missing header is `428 pow_required`; any other failure is `428 pow_invalid`. A verified solution is marked used at once, whatever happens to the report. The used set is in memory, pruned when entries expire, and capped at 1,000,000; when full, `/ingest` answers `503 pow_busy` with `Retry-After: 60`. A restart invalidates outstanding challenges.

### Prometheus metrics (dashboard listener, Bearer token)

```
gameplane_telemetry_reports_total{version="0.3.0"}      # counter, by version label
gameplane_telemetry_servers_bucket{le="…"}              # histogram (buckets: 0,1,2,5,10,25,50,100,250,+Inf), plus _sum and _count
gameplane_telemetry_templates_bucket{le="…"}            # histogram (same buckets), plus _sum and _count
gameplane_telemetry_duplicates_total                    # same-day repeat extended reports
gameplane_telemetry_extended_reports_total              # extended reports counted in the aggregates
gameplane_telemetry_rate_limited_total{route}           # route: ingest, login, summary, challenge
gameplane_telemetry_refused_total{reason}               # bad_signature, stale, id_claimed, replay, pow_required, pow_invalid, pow_busy
gameplane_telemetry_pow_challenges_total                # challenges issued
gameplane_telemetry_pow_bits                            # gauge: difficulty a challenge issued now would carry (0 when proof-of-work is off)
```

All series are in memory and reset on restart; the durable figures are the aggregates in SQLite.

## Key invariants

- **Stores daily aggregates and expiring activity records only, never raw reports or addresses**: the schema (`meta`, `daily_basic`, `daily_version`, `daily_fleet`, `daily_ext`, `daily_dim`, `daily_game`, `activity`) holds counts, bands and categories per UTC day, plus one activity record per install keyed by `HMAC-SHA256(pepper, installID)`. Source addresses live in limiter memory only and are never written to the store or the logs. No extended attribute is stored next to an install ID.
- **Basic or extended report, both strictly validated**: a body is accepted only when it decodes as exactly one basic report or one basic report with a valid `ext` part; anything else is `400`. Out-of-set values in extended categories fold to `other`.
- **Extended reports must be signed**: a report with `ext` and a missing or invalid signature is refused (`403 bad_signature`) before any write, and an install ID is bound to the first valid key that claims it.
- **Refusal invariant (dashboard)**: an unauthenticated dashboard response never contains a figure, a date other than page chrome, a version, category or module name, or anything that varies with whether data exists. A wrong token gets the same "Invalid credentials" login page whether or not the receiver is empty.
- **No token, no dashboard**: the dashboard listener is not started unless `DASHBOARD_TOKEN` is set, and a token shorter than 32 characters stops startup.
- **Version label bounded**: malformed strings become `version="invalid"`; after 128 distinct valid versions, new versions become `version="other"`. Concurrent requests share the same budget, and all accepted reports remain counted.
- **Refused reports change nothing**: signature, window, claim, replay and proof-of-work refusals write no data; a proof-of-work refusal costs one HMAC and one hash.
- **Single writer**: SQLite writes are serialized by one mutex; run one replica per database.
- **Graceful shutdown**: catches SIGINT/SIGTERM and shuts both listeners down with a 5s context timeout; the lifecycle job stops before the store closes.

## Data & persistence

SQLite at `$DATA_DIR/telemetry.db` (WAL, 5 s busy timeout). Aggregates are kept `RETENTION_DAYS` (default 730) and activity records `ACTIVITY_EXPIRY_DAYS` (default 90); an hourly job sweeps both. `meta` holds the schema version, collection start, the running report total and, unless `ID_PEPPER` is set, the pepper. Prometheus series, limiter state and the proof-of-work key and used set are in memory only. With `DATA_DIR` empty the whole store is in memory.

## Security considerations

- **Input boundary**: strict token-walking decode with exact case-sensitive keys, a 16 KiB body cap and per-field patterns or fixed lists; hostile text cannot create unbounded categories or labels.
- **Label safety**: version sanitization keeps the Prometheus label set bounded.
- **Authentication**: `AUTH_TOKEN` and the dashboard token are compared in constant time; the dashboard token needs at least 32 characters because per-source login limits can be outrun by a holder of many IPv6 /64s, so length is what makes guessing infeasible; the session cookie is HMAC-signed with a key derived from the token.
- **Proof-of-work**: raises the cost of bulk fabricated reports in proportion to request rate; it does not stop a determined, well-resourced sender (SHA-256 is cheap on dedicated hardware) and does not prove an install is real.
- **Signing**: stops impersonation of an existing install and replays; it does not stop invented installs.
- **Container hardening**: distroless image, nonroot user (UID 65532), no shell or package manager; static binary built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.
- **Dependencies**: `github.com/prometheus/client_golang`, `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go SQLite, no cgo) and the in-repo `telemetryschema` module (stdlib only); no serialization frameworks and no dynamic code loading.

## Testing & coverage

Coverage gate: **70%** (`.testcoverage.yml`).

Test suite covers:
- **Validation and ingest**: malformed, unknown-field, negative and oversized bodies; per-source daily limit; duplicate and replay handling
- **Signing and claims**: bad signature, stale send time, claimed ID, replay
- **Proof-of-work**: challenge issue and verification, difficulty rise and decay, used-set cap, `pow_busy`
- **Dashboard**: login, session cookie, CSRF origin check, refusal invariant, views JSON, metrics Bearer-only
- **Summary and limiters**: snapshot cache, rate limits, source-address derivation
- **Store and lifecycle**: schema, retention sweep, rollover, activity expiry
- **Config loading**: defaults, environment overrides, minimums and the 32-character token check
- **Cardinality**: version label budget

Untested (main process wiring): `main()` signal handling and server startup errors — not unit-testable without spawning goroutines, deferred to integration tests.
